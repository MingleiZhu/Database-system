# Relational Database Management System
Implemented a relational database management system with C++, the system is used to efficiently store, retrieve,
and run various queries on a large amount of data.
<br>
• Developed an LRU Buffer Manager which is responsible for moving physical pages back and forth from main
memory to disk, allowing our system to process data larger than available memory.
<br>
• Implemented a B+ Tree storing data for efficient retrieval in a block-oriented storage context, reducing the
number of I/O operations required to find an element in the tree.
<br>
• Built a Query Execution Engine that supports different kinds of relational operators like Scan Join, Hash
Join, SortMerge Join, Selection, and Aggregate.
<br>
• Designed and implemented a cost-based Query Optimizer, it can select a relational algebra expression having a
low cost for a given query using the statistics about the data.
